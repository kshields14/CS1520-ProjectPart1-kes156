Here is my Repo for Project Part 1. 

I tried to really make it look nice and presentable. 

I utilized images alot to make it very visually appealing. I also linked alot of other material that I thought was relevant. Additionally, 
all of the components are very responsive if you change the screen size, so that's good!

Here is the template that I started with, but I made a ton of changes to the style sheet and index, and also removed alot of 
unnecesary content: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/
